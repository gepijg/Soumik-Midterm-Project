This game is based on the bullet hell franchise. The objective of the game is to kill all the enemies and try to survive for as long as possible. You will have these small enemies that spawn in large groups which then will follow the player and move very quickly to try and collide and kill the player. With a drawback being it dies in one hit. You also have a tank that has a ton of health to take down. You have a sniper enemy that spawn in the back and fire shots from time to time dealing 1 damage. You have a meteor that if you collide with you dies and it can’t die and will despawn. Finally you have a boss fight where it fires a big laser. Controls WASD
